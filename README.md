 An extensive Microservice async program template example
<img width="35%" align="right" src="static/async_template_prog.png" alt=""/>

This code repository is an extensive async program example that covers useful building blocks
usable when creating unclouded Microservices on regular servers.

AsyncIO is a vital part of the building blocks, and it is used as much as possible in this example.

I have developed this on Windows, but I also cover Linux and macOS differences where needed.

This repository is described in a number of **Medium** articles.
